# X-Team 102 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

The leader of our group would be responsible to assign those tasks.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Everyone is responsible for updating progress on their assigned task, and the group leader is responsible for anyone who doesn't submit for their update.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

We will mention it in group chat and resovle the problem as a group.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

we are going to be in touch through different communication channels and make sure that every one is in the same page and take cares of his responsibilities.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
